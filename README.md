#What is this?
This is a repository for code that converts text files (.txt) into python files (.py) and vice versa.  
This only works for windows computer users... sorry.
#why did you create this?
I wanted to work on code on computers at my college but they do not have python installed.  So I made
this code so I can do that.
#Are their any risks for using this code?
This code will overwrite existing filenames (text to python overwrites python files, and python to text overwrites text files)
in BOTH THE FOLDERS AND SUBFOLDERS OF THE ADRESS YOU SPECIFIED.  That means all the folders in that folders will searched through!!!
#Recommendation you use it, make sure you save your python work to github so there is some file history.  .txt files do not have that 
#funtion, so be weary when overwriting them.

That said, the code is safe to use, and I have made it easy to understand.
#How do I use this?
assuming you have python installed properly on your computer, here is how you use it:
1.)Open the python file with vs code or however you may open it, (I recommend Vs code)
2.) Run the file
3.) the program will ask you to list the adress of the folder you are looking in.  This will include the folders in the folders besides the actual folders
  NOTE: it will error out if you dont do this correctly.  It just will not work, no big deal.
3.5.) To get the adress, open the folder you want to convert things, go to the adress bar and right click.  You hsould see a menu bar, and select copy adress.
4.) right click into the vs code terminal and it will paste the adress.
5.) run the code, and you should have it working

#Does this work on word documents?
No, it does not work on word documentss.
#does this work on jupiter notebooks?
No, it does not work on jupiter notebooks.  
I have not attempted to try my hand at that yet and do not intend to due to lack of interest.
#Are you comming back to this repository to work on anything else?
Probably not, so don't wait.  I will be working on other things.
